# Self_Driving_Car

This was a summer project of my own , where first i turn an rc car into an into a car controlled with voice commands with the help of google API, and using a raspberry pi to control the motors. Second, i used a a web cam and Machine Learning to make the car recognize stop signs. The last part of the project will be using Machine Learning to make this toy an autonomous car.
For now, the project contains only the software part, but in the near future i will also put here the hardware part.
Due to the low capacity on the microSD where i installed the OS for the raspberry pi , and given the short budget for the project , i cannot install the openCV library on the pi , so i installed on my laptop instead and used web cam of my smartphone, via ip cam, making the laptop sending commands to the pi in order to when it sees a stop sign, make the car stop.
I know , i was unecessary, but make me learn all about the mechanics of TCP connections as well, so it wasn't that bad.
