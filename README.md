# Self_Driving_Car

This was a summer project of my own, where first I turn an RC car into a car controlled with voice commands with the help of Google API and using a raspberry pi to control the motors. Second, I used a webcam and Machine Learning to make the car recognize stop signs. The last part of the project will be using Machine Learning to make this toy an autonomous car.
For now, the project contains only the software part, but soon, I will also put here the hardware part.
Due to the low capacity on the microSD where I have installed the OS for the raspberry pi, and given the short budget for the project, I could not install the OpenCV library on the pi, so I installed on my laptop instead and used my smartphone's webcam, via IP cam, making the laptop sending commands to the pi to when it sees a stop sign, make the car stop.
I know, it was unnecessary, but make me learn all about the mechanics of TCP connections as well, so it wasn't that bad.
